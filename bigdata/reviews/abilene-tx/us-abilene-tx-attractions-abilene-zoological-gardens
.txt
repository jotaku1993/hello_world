<p>Even though in general terms i am against the zoo, since i prefer to see the animals free in nature, nevertheless the Abilene Zoo is one of the best zoos i have seen in small towns.</p>
<p>Certainly it is an ideal place for families to visit it during the afternoon hours and for kids to see from close how wild animals look like. There is a great range of animals, reptiles and birds, including some scary ones such as lions, tigers, and bears. But i have to admit that giraffes are the main attraction of this place. Really awesome and beautiful animals and it is a real pleasure to feed them with crackers! The main advantage of this zoo is that it is clean and animals are kept in relatively big spaces.</p>

<p>We love the Abilene zoo! They have been working really hard on adding new animals and exhibits! On the weekends if you get there before 1pm you can feed the giraffes crackers for only $1! Great place for everyone!</p>
