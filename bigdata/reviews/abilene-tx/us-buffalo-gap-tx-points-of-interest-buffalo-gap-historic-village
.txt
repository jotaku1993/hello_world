<p>I went here with my grandmother quite a few times when I was a child and had a fantastic time! There was also the white buffalo outside of Buffalo Gap but I heard he's been moved since then. It's preserved wonderfully. My favorite parts were the chapel and the doctors office. A definite must-see, especially if you have children!</p>

<p>The Historic Village is a unique collection of historic buildings filled with artifacts from historic West Texas. Our mission is to interpret the last fifty years (1875-1925) of the history of the Texas frontier. We employ a variety of interpretive programs, including static exhibits, historic structures, and living history interpreters to extend and accomplish that goal. Come visit us in scenic Buffalo Gap, Texas!</p>
